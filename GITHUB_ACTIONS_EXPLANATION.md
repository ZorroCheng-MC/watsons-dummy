# GitHub Actions Workflows Explanation

## The Two Workflows You See:

### 1. "Deploy to GitHub Pages" (Our Custom Workflow)
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: Builds your Vite project and deploys it properly
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working correctly
- **Keep**: YES - This is the one we want

### 2. "pages build and deployment" (GitHub's Default)
- **File**: `dynamic/pages/pages-build-deployment` (auto-generated)
- **Purpose**: GitHub's default Jekyll-based deployment
- **Status**: ‚ùå Causing the MIME type issues
- **Keep**: YES - This will automatically stop running once you change the settings

## ‚úÖ What You Should Do:

**DO NOT DELETE EITHER WORKFLOW**

Instead, just change the GitHub Pages source setting as described in `CRITICAL_MANUAL_STEPS.md`:

1. Go to Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Change Source from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save

## üîÑ What Happens After You Change the Setting:

### Before (Current):
- ‚ùå "pages build and deployment" runs and serves your site (causing MIME errors)
- ‚úÖ "Deploy to GitHub Pages" runs but isn't used by GitHub Pages

### After (Fixed):
- ‚úÖ "Deploy to GitHub Pages" runs and serves your site (no MIME errors)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è "pages build and deployment" will stop running automatically

## üéØ Key Points:

1. **Don't delete anything** - GitHub will handle this automatically
2. **The default workflow will stop** once you switch to GitHub Actions source
3. **Your custom workflow will take over** and serve the correct files
4. **This is the standard way** to migrate from branch deployment to Actions deployment

## üîç After the Change:

You'll only see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running for future deployments, and the default one will become inactive.

---

**TL;DR: Keep both workflows, just change the GitHub Pages source setting. GitHub will automatically use the right one and stop using the problematic one.**
