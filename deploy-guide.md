# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Issue Diagnosis
The MIME type error occurs because GitHub Pages doesn't serve JavaScript modules with the correct MIME type by default.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Vite Configuration Updates
- Added `base: "/watsons-water-clone/"` to match your repository name
- Configured proper build settings for GitHub Pages

### 2. Jekyll Bypass
- Added `.nojekyll` file in the public directory to prevent Jekyll processing
- This ensures JavaScript modules are served with correct MIME types

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automated deployment
- This will build and deploy your site automatically on push

### 4. Manual Deployment Steps (if needed)

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The built files will be in the `dist/` directory

3. Push the `dist/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   # If you need to deploy manually
   npm install -g gh-pages
   gh-pages -d dist
   ```

### 5. GitHub Pages Settings
Make sure your GitHub Pages is configured to:
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: gh-pages (if using manual deployment) or main/master (if using GitHub Actions)

## Expected Result
After these changes, your site should load properly without MIME type errors.

## Troubleshooting
If you still see issues:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check that the base URL in vite.config.ts matches your repository name
3. Ensure the .nojekyll file is present in the deployed files
